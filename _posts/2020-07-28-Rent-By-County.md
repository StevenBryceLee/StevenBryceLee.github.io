Many costs in life are unavoidable, rent being foremost for many people. Rent interests me because it is a big cost for the average person in the United States. I suspect that the county in which a person chooses to live would actually change their quality of life by affecting how much of their income goes to rent each month. Based on which counties have the lowest percentage of your income going to rent, I think living in those counties would be better than living in counties where rent is much higher. Finally, I assume that rent is different in different places. Unless movies about New York City have lied to me, I would bet this is true.

As far as the actual analysis, luckily the department of Housing and Urban Development collects data on rental costs, and the Department of Agriculture captures data on median income. Let's take a look at what the United States looks like at the county level, based on the percentage of income that the median person pays. 
See a bigger version: https://bit.ly/2DfGUmIWe can see that the percent of income that a person pays seems to increase when we live near major cities. You can see this up the California coast, and around Maryland. Interestingly, most of Florida has very high rent compared to how much people earn, while in most mid-Western states, people get to keep a higher percentage of their income. 
Most people in the United States live in cities, not in rural areas, so we will look at which counties which hold cities are outperforming and underperforming the average. Although cities are different by what it is like to live there, knowing which counties are going to take more or less of your income would be very important for deciding where to live.

Top 20 most populous counties in the U.S.Interestingly, the graph is skewed towards expensive areas being much more expensive than cheap areas are cheap. Maricopa County, home of Phoenix, is 5% below the mean while Kings County, home of Brooklyn, is more than 10% above the mean. Given this, we should be very careful about moving to Kings County unless we have a lot of money. Additionally, more counties are cheaper than the mean than more expensive. We have more options about where to live where we will not lose too much of our income to rent, so if we have the choice, we should find some place that we love from the cheaper places to live.
